##This is a supporting data repository for the Exomiser-Tutorial:

download the data via
```
wget https://github.com/iQuxLE/Exomiser-Tutorial/blob/main/Exomiser-Tutorial.zip
```
or clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/iQuxLE/Exomiser-Tutorial.git
```

unzip with 

```
unzip Exomiser-Tutorial.zip
```

Since the VCF file for the Pfeiffer example data is a bit bigger you need to download that seperately and put it into the Exomiser-Tutorial folder.

```
wget https://github.com/iQuxLE/Exomiser-Tutorial/blob/main/pfeiffer-family-vcf.zip
```

```
unzip pfeiffer-family-vcf.zip -d Exomiser-Tutorial/exomiser-config/
```
